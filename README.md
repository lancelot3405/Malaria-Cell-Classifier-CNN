# 🔬 Automated Malaria Cell Classifier using CNN

### 1. Problem Definition
The project addresses the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of identifying malaria parasites in red blood cell images via microscopy. The objective is to automate this process to assist diagnostic accuracy and speed, especially in low-resource settings (Healthcare Theme).

### 2. Solution and Concepts Applied
This solution uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform binary image classification.
* **Core CV Concept:** Image Classification and Feature Extraction.
* **Model:** Custom CNN architecture with 2 Conv2D layers.
* **Dataset:** NIH Malaria Cell Images Dataset (Parasitized vs. Uninfected).
* **Techniques:** Data Augmentation (Rotation, Zoom, Shift) and Adam Optimization.
